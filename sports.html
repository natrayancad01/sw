<p>On Monday, the Board of Control for Cricket in India named multiple squads for India’s all-format tour of South Africa where the Test series will especially be in focus.

The selectors looked beyond two Test veterans while potential future stars were given a break. Only Mukesh Kumar, Shreyas Iyer and Ruturaj Gaikwad were named for all three formats.</p>
